"""groundtruth.py — confirm a finding by RUNNING a repro, not by reasoning.

For a testable finding, ask the model to write a self-contained script that exits
0 IFF the bug reproduces, then execute it. The interpreter's exit code is the
verdict — the one truly independent verifier (the world), breaking the solver's
closed loop.

Design choice (safety + the symmetric-burden rule): a successful repro CONFIRMS
(adds hard positive evidence); a failed/absent repro only ANNOTATES "could not
reproduce" — it never KILLS a finding, because a weak model's bad repro must not
be allowed to discard a real bug. Execution is used to raise confidence, not to
manufacture false negatives.
