"""Loop-until-dry discovery — for "find ALL of X" where the count is unknown.

Keep dispatching discovery rounds until K *consecutive* rounds surface nothing
new, deduping every round against a persistent seen-set so the loop converges
instead of re-finding the same things forever. Two stop conditions the doctrine
demanded beyond the upstream fixed-list approach:

  * DRY: K consecutive rounds with zero fresh findings (the classic).
  * DIMINISHING RETURNS: fresh-yield per round decays toward noise — a track
    that keeps returning near-duplicates resets the naive K-counter while adding
    nothing, so we also stop when the marginal yield flattens. (Watch the
    derivative, not just the level.)

Every bound is ANNOUNCED via the returned report (no silent caps). ``round_fn``
is injected (a thunk that runs one finder fan-out and returns its Findings), so
this controller is fully testable with scripted rounds and no model.
