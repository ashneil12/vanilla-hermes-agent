"""judge.py — the judge-panel shape for GENERATIVE tasks.

Find-then-verify is wrong for creative/open-ended work; the doctrine's shape there
is: generate N independent attempts from DIFFERENT angles, score them with
independent judges, then synthesize the winner while grafting the best survivable
ideas from the runners-up. More candidates make a blander pick, so the funnel is
throttled (cover the stance-space with a few seeds, not many).
