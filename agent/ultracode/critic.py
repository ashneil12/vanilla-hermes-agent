"""Completeness critic — the from-scratch "what's missing?" pass.

After discovery + verification, a single tools-off pass asks: what modality was
NOT run, what claim is unverified, what source is unread, what cell is unowned?
Its output becomes the next discovery round's targets (loop integration) and is
ALWAYS surfaced in the final report (no-silent-caps).

Honest caveat encoded in the contract (deep-residual lens): this critic is the
SAME model with correlated priors — "from-scratch" is a role, not true
independence. So its verdict is treated as UNKNOWN-not-clean: an empty gap list
means "I found no gap", never "there are no gaps". Genuine independence needs a
different generator (a tool, a fresh measurement, the human) — that escalation is
the harness's job, not this function's claim.
