"""compute.py — execution as a reasoning aid.

A weak model's reasoning fails on systematic search / enumeration / simulation (find the
smallest binary multiple, min jug-pours, constrained knapsack, a long iteration) — but it
can WRITE correct code for exactly those, and the runtime executes it reliably. This is the
single biggest cognitive lever for a weak model: let it RUN the search instead of doing it
in its head, the same way an expert recognizes "this is computable" and writes the program.

The agent decides (it is told it MAY decline with NOT_COMPUTABLE for tasks that are pure
reasoning, like a logic puzzle). On a runtime error it gets ONE retry with the error fed
back. A successful run is ground truth for the computable part — high confidence.
