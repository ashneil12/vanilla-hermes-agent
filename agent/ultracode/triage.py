"""triage.py — discernment. The single most important lesson from the benchmark.

Ultracode lost on easy tasks because it ALWAYS went full-metal. A real ultracode
operator doesn't: it does a quick solo pass, then asks "would spinning up a
multi-agent orchestration actually change the answer, or am I already done?" —
and most of the time, stays solo. That judgment is the difference between a 78×-
cost gimmick and a tool you leave on.

This module is that judgment as a cheap, tools-off call: given a solo attempt,
decide whether to escalate. Orchestrate ONLY when the task is large, multi-
faceted, high-stakes, or solo confidence is low. Default to solo — exactly the
doctrine's restraint rule, now applied to the harness's own effort.
