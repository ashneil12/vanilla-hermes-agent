"""Adversarial verification — the cognitive core, and the thing no upstream PR has.

The stance, straight from the doctrine: for each load-bearing finding, spawn K
*independent* skeptics, each looking through a DIFFERENT failure-lens, each
instructed to REFUTE and to default the verdict to ``refuted`` under uncertainty.
A finding survives only on a quorum of confirmations. Two refinements the
distillation insisted on:

  * KILL THE KILLER — a refutation must itself state a mechanism; a skeptic that
    says "looks wrong" without a reason is as suspect as a finder that says
    "looks fine". This protects a correct front-runner from a miscalibrated kill.
  * REPORTS ARE TESTIMONY, NOT FACT — a skeptic that asserts a verdict with no
    rationale/evidence is downgraded to ``refuted`` (uncertain), because the most
    dangerous unaudited input is the orchestrator believing its own workers.

Concurrency is a SIBLING delegate fan-out (one subagent per finding×lens), never
threaded ``call_llm`` — see CONTRACTS.md §2 (call_llm's routing globals are not
thread-safe) and §1 (verifiers as siblings dodge the depth=1 nesting cap).
