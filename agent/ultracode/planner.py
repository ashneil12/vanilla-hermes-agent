"""planner.py — PLAN(tools-off) -> subtasks, with the scale-to-the-ask gate.

A bounded, tools-off LLM call turns a task into a small set of orthogonal
subtasks (the work-list). Shape adopted from upstream PR #35978's
PLAN->fan-out->SYNTHESIZE split, with the fixes the critique demanded: a real
JSON extractor with repair (not greedy regex), an ANNOUNCED cap (not a silent
[:8]), and a scale-DOWN gate (a single trivial subtask -> fall back to solo).

The planner is told to decompose by the PROBLEM-NATIVE axis (hypothesis / lens /
region), never by the surface unit (file) — the doctrine's cardinal rule —
because a weak model will default to by-file unless told otherwise. That
instruction is the difference between lazy and real, and it is exactly what a
weaker model exposes.
