"""mode.py — the /ultracode toggle: cache-safe standing injection + xhigh effort.

Enabling ultracode does two things to the live agent, both reversible:
  1. pins reasoning to xhigh (snapshot/restore, one source of truth);
  2. appends a compact standing directive to ``agent.ephemeral_system_prompt`` —
     which CONTRACTS.md §5 confirms is injected at API-call time, AFTER the cached
     system-prompt prefix, so it never breaks the Anthropic prompt cache. The
     directive is byte-stable across turns, so it stays cache-safe.

The directive is the *standing default*; the real enforcement lives in the
agent/ultracode harness (the structure the model can't bypass). This is the
"flip the behavior" surface — `/ultracode [on|off|status]`.

    "(2) FAN OUT independent units with delegate_task. "

    "(4) For 'find all', LOOP until two rounds find nothing new, then run a completeness critic. "
    "(5) GROUND-TRUTH every load-bearing conclusion once by actually running/reading/testing it — "
    "reasoning is never a substitute for checking. "
