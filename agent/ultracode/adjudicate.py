"""adjudicate.py — turn a false-positive machine into an accurate one.

The verification upgrade for IMPORTANT code. A skeptic VOTE is cheap and shares
the finder's blind spots; adjudication forces the steps a careful auditor does:
expand the context to the WHOLE file (so cross-file guards are visible), trace the
source->sink path, demand that NO mitigating guard sits on it, name the attacker
and the trust boundary actually crossed — and put the BURDEN OF PROOF on the
finding (false-positive until proven). This is what killed 8/12 hermes false
positives when Claude did it by hand.

Composes with: execution-arbiter (run a repro where testable) and a stronger
verify backend (break correlated errors). Adjudication is the reasoning gate;
execution is the ground-truth gate; the strong model is the reliability gate.
