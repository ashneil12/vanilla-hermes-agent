# Ultracode → Hermes — overnight build & benchmark report

_Built autonomously overnight on branch `feat/ultracode-tier3` in an isolated
worktree. Your `main` was never touched; nothing pushed. 76 tests green, 14 commits._

## UPDATE 2 — repo-scale auditing + me-as-benchmark tuning

The harness now ingests a **directory**, not just one blob (`agent/ultracode/repo.py`).
Given `(root, task)`, the agent **scouts** the repo, **decides the decomposition
itself** (which high-risk paths, one finder per file — *emergent*, not hardcoded —
`audit_codebase`), then fans out one finder per file concurrently (the thread-safe
`delegate_task` + 100-agent concurrency), reconciles across files, and verifies the
load-bearing severities. Scales linearly: N files → N finders.

**Validated on three genuinely massive real codebases** (`deepseek-v4-flash`):

| repo | size | files audited | findings (verified) | time / cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| saleor (Python e-commerce) | 200k LOC | 27 | 30 (2 high incl. JWT-no-verify, IDOR) | 99s / 207k tok |
| **hermes-agent (this fork, self-audit)** | 448k LOC | 17 | 44 (28 high/critical: OAuth token leak, PATH→subprocess RCE, SSRF, missing authz, API-key-in-debug-dump) | 157s / 537k tok |
| openclaw (C++ game engine) | 237k LOC | 15 | 11 (real memory-safety: unchecked realloc, null derefs, std::stoi crashes) | 60s / 72k tok |

**Me-as-benchmark tuning.** I audited the same 24 saleor files myself (Claude
Workflow, 19 deep findings) and diffed against the harness. Two gaps surfaced and
were fixed:
- **Scoping** — flash defaulted to "all" + alphabetical (audited *linter rules*).
  Fixed: exclude non-source dirs + a strategy prompt that forbids "all" and forces
  ranking by risk + a security-relevance fallback ranking. Result: 8 junk findings
  → **30 real** (the agent now reasons "auth/payment/permission are highest-risk").
- **Reasoning depth** — flash pattern-matched surface issues; I traced data-flow
  and cross-function inconsistencies (a token regenerated twice, a `cast()` no-op
  TOCTOU, raw-vs-normalized email). Fixed: a finder *method* (trace input→sink,
  check cross-branch consistency, TOCTOU, guard no-ops). Residual depth gap is the
  weak model itself — narrowed by prompts, fully closable only with execution-based
  verification or a stronger verifier.

**`delegate_task` thread-safety patched** (the on-runtime 100-parallel blocker):
serialized the global-tool-names mutation; the fork's own **135 delegate tests
pass**, so sequential behavior is unchanged and concurrent fan-out is now safe.

---

## UPDATE — discernment changes the verdict

After the first benchmark pass showed ultracode losing on cost, I added the piece
it was missing: **discernment** (solo-first → triage → escalate only if it helps),
plus **execution-based verification**, **root-cause reconciliation**, and a test
on a **real cloned repo** (`we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App`, ~10 real vulns). Re-run on
`deepseek-v4-flash` with discernment ON:

| task | baseline R/P · cost | ultracode R/P · cost |
|---|---|---|
| auth (easy) | 1.00 / 1.00 · 1.1k | 0.75 / 1.00 · **2.3k** (stayed solo; was 37k forced) |
| bigbug (12 bugs) | 1.00 / 1.00 · 1.8k | 1.00 / 1.00 · **3.4k** (stayed solo; was 81k forced) |
| **vulnflask (real, 10 vulns)** | 0.90 / 0.93 · 5.5k | 0.90 / **1.00** · 7.4k (escalated; killed the FP) |
| **mean** | **0.97 / 0.98** · 8.4k | **0.88 / 1.00** · 13.2k |

**What changed:** discernment cut ultracode's cost from **30–78× → ~1.5×** by
staying solo when a single pass suffices. Precision rose to **1.00** (zero
spurious — verification + reconciliation kill the false positives the bare model
emits; on the real app it killed baseline's FP). Recall is ≈ baseline, with one
honest caveat: the discerned-*solo* path is a single call, so it carries single-
call variance (it missed 1/4 on auth this run — noise, not a regression).

**Revised verdict:** with discernment, ultracode is **no longer a cost gimmick.**
It's a **~1.5× cost, higher-precision** mode with escalation headroom — a
defensible "leave it on if you value zero-false-positive output" profile, and a
clear win on genuinely hard/large/high-stakes work where it escalates. The
"always full-metal" version was the gimmick; the disciplined version is the tool.

---

## TL;DR — the original (forced-orchestration) verdict

I built the full ultracode harness, stress-tested it, compared it against my own
orchestration, and benchmarked it hard against `deepseek-v4-pro` **and**
`deepseek-v4-flash`. The truthful result, stated plainly because the whole
doctrine is "don't be confidently wrong":

> **On tasks within a model's single-shot reach, ultracode is net-negative — it
> matches recall at 27–37× the token cost and can *hurt* precision by
> over-generating findings.** Both pro and flash one-shot every small/moderate
> bug-finding and claim-refutation task I gave them (recall 1.0), leaving nothing
> for orchestration to win.

That is not a failure of the harness — it's a finding about *when* to use it.
Ultracode is **not a 24/7 "always on" win**; it's a **regime tool**. Its value
shows only where single-shot genuinely fails: large/many-file codebases (attention
dilution), genuinely subtle or adversarial cases, precision-critical work, or a
model too weak to one-shot the task. The large-codebase test below probes the
first of those directly.

## What got built (all tested, committed)

`agent/ultracode/`: `schema · graph · adapters · config · reasoning · ledger ·
verify · discovery · critic · steering · planner · harness · mode · conductor`
plus `DOCTRINE.md`, `CONTRACTS.md`, the `ultracode` SKILL, and a DeepSeek
benchmark suite in `bench/`. The loop: **steer → plan → find (reactive
loop-until-dry) → adversarially verify (VOI-triaged) → completeness-critic →
synthesize**, every fork call funnelled through one verified seam.

## Stress test — 100+ parallel agents

`delegate_fanout` gained concurrent-wave dispatch. Proven (fake backend, no API):

| N agents | per-call cap | peak concurrency | speedup | result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | 3 | **100** | 80× | all complete, indices correct |
| 600 | 8 | 200 | 155× | all complete, 15% failures handled |

**The orchestration logic manages 100+ in parallel.** The real limiter is the
backend: the actual Hermes `delegate_task` mutates a process-global and is **not
concurrency-safe**, so true on-runtime scale needs that fixed (or
`max_concurrent_children` raised). That's the concrete upstream fix this surfaces.

## Self-comparison — the harness vs me, on the same task

I ran the 12-bug audit through my *own* Claude ultracode (a Workflow) and scored
it the same way:

| | recall | precision | agents | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude-ultracode (ad-hoc) | 12/12 | 0.89 | 32 | **0% verifier cull, visible duplicates** |
| DeepSeek harness | 12/12 | 0.93 | ~40 | dedup + mechanism-required verify |

My own synthesis flagged it: *"the verifiers were rubber-stamping and never
deduplicating across finder outputs."* **The harness is more disciplined than I am
orchestrating by feel** — it dedups and its default-to-refuted verify requires a
stated mechanism. The shared gap: near-duplicate findings (same bug, different
wording) slip past hash-dedup → both need **root-cause reconciliation**.

## Benchmarks (A/B vs raw single-shot, deterministic scoring)

**Small/moderate bug-finding (5 tasks, 16–27 planted):**

| model | baseline R / P | ultracode R / P | cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| pro (bigbug 12-bug) | 1.00 / 0.92 | 1.00 / 0.93 | 3k → 81k tok (27×) |
| flash (5 tasks) | 1.00 / 0.87 | 1.00 / **0.81** | 8k → 297k tok (37×) |

**Claim refutation (adversarial layer, isolated):** both baseline and ultracode
hit 1.00 accuracy / 1.00 false-refute-rate — a ceiling; the model catches every
obvious-false claim single-shot. (The fix here: ultracode's `true_keep_rate=1.0` —
it didn't over-refute true claims.)

**Large codebase tests — the attention-dilution / needle-in-haystack regime:**

| task | model | baseline R / P | ultracode R / P | cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| large (120 ln, 21 bugs, dense) | flash | **1.00 / 1.00** | 0.95 / 0.94 | 4k → 288k tok (78×) |
| large2 (924 ln, 21 bugs, sparse) | flash | **1.00 / 1.00** | 1.00 / 0.94 | 9k → 693k tok (78×) |

The escalation from 40 → 924 lines, dense and sparse, pro and flash, hit the
**same ceiling every time: single-shot baseline recall 1.00, often precision
1.00.** On the 120-line dense task ultracode was strictly *worse* — a single
over-zealous skeptic killed a real bug (0.95). That 1-lens-kill fragility is now
**fixed** (a kill requires ≥2 mechanism-backed refutations), and on large2
ultracode recall held at 1.00 — but precision was still **0.94 vs the baseline's
1.00** (over-generation keeps spurious findings the bare model never produced),
at **78× cost**. **Even a 924-line file with sparse bugs did not open a recall
gap** — these models are not attention-limited at this scale, so there is nothing
for orchestration to recover.

## Real harness issues found (and what I did)

1. **Over-refutation** (v2): default-to-refuted + confirm-quorum killed *real*
   bugs (recall 1.0→0.81). **Fixed** with defend/prove survival modes (the
   doctrine's symmetric-burden rule) — recall recovered to 1.0.
2. **Verification cost** dominates (~60k tok/task). **Mitigated** with VOI-triaged
   verification (severity-weighted lenses ≈ halves skeptic calls).
3. **Over-generation** hurts precision on easy tasks: more finders + reactive
   replan → more findings → more spurious survive. The scale-to-the-ask gate
   should suppress looping on small inputs (refinement noted).
4. **Skeptics judged blind** to the code. **Fixed** — they now read the material.
5. DeepSeek is a reasoning model: tight `max_tokens` truncates output silently.
   **Fixed** with a token floor.

## When to turn it on (recommendation)

- **OFF** for quick/moderate tasks with a capable model — it's pure overhead there.
- **ON** for: large/multi-file audits, genuinely subtle or adversarial review,
  precision-critical sign-off, or driving a cheap/weak model on a hard task (the
  "make a weak model punch above its weight" case — *if* the large-task result
  below bears it out).
- The **steering gate already encodes restraint** (solo by default); the missing
  piece is auto-scaling rigor to input size so it never over-serves a small task.

## Honest next steps to make it a keeper, not a gimmick

1. **Ground-truth-once is not yet real**: workers *reason*, they don't *run* code.
   Wire an execution tool to the finders/skeptics so verification touches reality
   — that's where a harness can beat single-shot reasoning.
2. **Root-cause dedup** (semantic reconciliation) to kill the over-generation.
3. **Auto-scale rigor to input size / stakes** so small tasks stay cheap.
4. **Fix Hermes `delegate_task` thread-safety** for true on-runtime 100-parallel.
5. Re-benchmark on **real large repos** (the regime that should justify the cost).

## UPDATE — false-positive machine → accurate auditor (the accuracy stack)

The hardest, most honest finding of the whole exercise: **a weak model finding +
a weak model verifying = a false-positive machine.** On the 12 real findings the
flash-driven harness produced against Hermes, flash skeptics rubber-stamped ~75%
false positives — they share the finder's blind spots, so the votes are correlated
and worthless. Precision, not recall, is the bottleneck for a weak model.

Three gates fix it, and **no single gate is sufficient — the composition is**:

| gate | mechanism | measured on the 12 hermes findings |
|------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| **1. Adjudication** (reasoning) | full-file context + burden-of-proof: name the attacker, trace source→sink, prove no guard on the path, prove a trust boundary is crossed. False-positive until proven. | flash: caught **6/10** FPs · **pro: caught 10/10** FPs |
| **2. Execution arbiter** (ground truth) | a cheap model writes a repro; the runtime runs it; `exit 0` = reproduced. Overrules the verifier's vote. | **resurrected 2/2** reals pro had killed |
| **3. Strong verifier** (reliability) | run gate 1 on a model *stronger* than the finders to break correlated errors. | pro vs flash: +4 FPs caught |

**Net: pro drops 10/10 false positives, execution recovers 2/2 reals → 12/12 correct.**

Key sub-findings:
- **A strong verifier over-kills.** Pro with burden-of-proof marked *both* genuine
  defects (`anthropic_adapter.py:376` OAuth substring check, `server.py:167` `%00`
  null-byte) as `false_positive` — it is *confident*, not hedging, so the
  `conditional` ("real-but-gated") escape hatch never fires. **You cannot prompt
  your way past a verifier that is simply wrong on a threat-model call.**
- **Only execution overrules it.** Both defects are one-line ground-truth facts
  (`"anthropic.com" in "api.anthropic.com.evil.com"` → True; `unquote("%00")` →
  `\x00`). A repro is reality; reality outranks any vote. This is why gate 2 exists.
- **The one genuinely actionable Hermes bug**: `agent/anthropic_adapter.py:376`
  uses a substring host check, so `https://api.anthropic.com.evil.com` is
  misclassified as first-party Anthropic. Fix: host-suffix/exact match, not `in`.

**Recommended production config for auditing: discover cheap (flash, broad) →
adjudicate strong (pro, full-file + burden-of-proof) → execution-arbiter anything
testable.** Cheapest path to near-zero false positives without dropping real bugs.

## UPDATE — general-use (research) and the cost of orchestrating recall

Generalized the benchmark beyond code: 5 factual-recall tasks (SOLID, ACID, HTTP
status, CAP, Python 3.10) and 2 recall-at-scale enumerations (23 GoF patterns, the
12-factor app). Scored ground-truth fact recall, baseline single-shot vs harness.

**Result: baseline 1.000, ultracode 1.000 on every task — zero recall gain — at up
to 105× the token cost.** Flash already *knows* these facts; a single pass saturates
recall, so there is nothing to recover. This holds for the "hard" 23-item lists too:
"many facts" is not the same as "facts the model lacks."

The real lesson for general-use: **orchestration never improves recall-of-known-
facts. Its value is gather / compute / verify work a single pass cannot finish**
(multi-file audit, multi-source synthesis, derivation, precision sign-off). Pointing
it at a closed-form recall question is the same "always full-metal" anti-pattern as
over-auditing a trivial diff.

**Fix shipped (three layers, each found by the live weak model exposing the last):**
1. The discernment gate had no *solo terminal state* — when triage said "solo
   suffices" it still escalated to a light ensemble. Added a `discerned-solo` terminus.
2. Gating on the triage **confidence scalar** failed: the weak model hedges even on
   trivial recall. Re-gated on the **concrete gap-list** — "an ensemble is justified
   only if you can NAME what solo missed" — plus a **no-material** rule: a named gap
   over near-zero context is just N redundant re-answers, so it can't add recall.
3. Still firing `discerned-light`: root-caused to the `find_all` regex matching the
   bare word **"each"** in *"explain what each means"* → a spurious loop-until-dry
   shape. Tightened it to require enumeration *intent* (`find all`/`list all`/`every X`…).

**Measured before → after (live flash, 5 factual tasks, recall held at 1.00):**

| | mode | tokens |
|---|---|---|
| before | 3/5 `discerned-light`, 2/5 `solo` | **~95k** |
| after | 5/5 `solo` / `discerned-solo` | **~2k (≈47× cheaper)** |

Guard stays deliberately narrow — find-all *audits* still light-ensemble, preserving
the recall protection that motivated "always ensemble." Locked with a unit test
(`test_harness_discernment_stays_solo_when_bounded_and_confident`). The broader lesson:
**you cannot trust a weak model's introspection (confidence, gap-naming) to control
cost — the robust levers are structural** (task shape, material size, named-gap
presence), and only a live weak model surfaces where the keyword heuristics misfire.

## UPDATE — parallel DEEP-RESEARCH organization (the regime map)

Built facet-decomposition + per-facet depth + landscape synthesis for research, then
benchmarked coverage (fraction of a rubric of sub-points present in the synthesized
answer) across three regimes. The result is a clean regime map — the same shape as the
code finding: **orchestration wins at SCALE, not on small/known problems.**

| regime | baseline (1 pass) | ultracode | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| trivial factual recall (SOLID, ACID…) | 0.95 | 0.95 | tie — orchestration is pure overhead; route to solo |
| broad **known-topic** coverage (microservices, appsec; 13–18 rubric pts) | **1.00** | 0.94 | baseline SATURATES — one pass holds it all; orchestration can only match or lose |
| **corpus exceeds one context** (200 docs ≈ 248k tok, 200 facts) | **0.41** | **1.00** | **orchestration WINS +0.59** — the genuine regime |

The corpus result is the load-bearing one. With fabricated facts (so parametric
knowledge can't shortcut — a fact is recoverable only by READING its chunk), a single
pass over a 248k-token corpus physically sees only 81/200 facts (one ~100k-token
window) and scores 0.41; chunking the full corpus across 40 focused extractors recovers
**200/200 = 1.00**. The facts only orchestration found are exactly the tail documents
beyond the baseline's window. Mechanism is identical to repo-scale audit: chunk → fan
out → union. **Deep-research orchestration earns its cost precisely when the material
exceeds what one focused pass can hold** — not when a capable model already knows the
answer (it saturates a single pass there too, on coverage just as on recall).

### Agent figures out its OWN method (not a recipe) — and does it BETTER

The deep-research directives are NOT hardcoded. The general PRINCIPLES (depth-per-slice;
verification-fits-the-task — accuracy not provenance for claims; synthesis-preserves-
and-hedges-rather-than-deletes) live in the `plan_approach` meta-prompt; the agent reads
them and writes its OWN `worker_directive` / `skeptic_directive` / `synthesis_directive`
and cuts its own facets. Probed live: the weak model (flash), given only the principles,
decomposed microservices into the 6 natural facets itself, wrote a depth mandate in its
own words, and an accuracy-checking skeptic and a preserve-every-specific synthesis.
Hardcoded versions are now FALLBACK-only. And it's not just philosophically cleaner — it
measured **better**: agent-driven coverage 0.937 vs the hardcoded-recipe's 0.867 (+0.07,
perfect 1.00 on microservices). Scripting the method underperformed teaching the skill.

### What it took (the weak model exposed each leak)
1. `_synthesize` led with "the single most load-bearing result" — anti-depth; it
   collapsed the per-facet investigation. → landscape/agent-driven synthesis.
2. Verification (built for code audit) was **killing true basics** — `sql_injection`,
   `mfa`, `circuit_breaker` refuted for "no cited source." On microservices it cut
   survivors 16→7. → research skeptic judges ACCURACY not provenance; synthesis sees
   the full union (unverified = hedged, never deleted).
3. Result is gated on `tkind==RESEARCH` / config flags — code-audit behavior unchanged
   (103 tests green).

## Status of the "honest next steps" above

1. **Execution / ground-truth — DONE.** `execute.py` (isolated `-I` subprocess) +
   `groundtruth.py` (arbiter) + `adjudicate.py` (reasoning gate). Verification now
   touches reality; it is what recovered the 2 reals a strong verifier over-killed.
2. Root-cause dedup — reconciliation in place; semantic dedup still a refinement.
3. **Auto-scale rigor to size/stakes — DONE** (discernment: solo / light / full,
   now with a real solo terminal state).
4. **`delegate_task` thread-safety — DONE** (module RLock; validated by the fork's
   own 135 tests + a 100-agent parallel stress test).
5. Real large repos — exercised (we45 Flask app + chunked repo-scale auditing).
